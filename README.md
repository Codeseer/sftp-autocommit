# sftp-autocommit
Pulls production code from an SFTP server and git commit &amp;&amp; git pushes any changes to a branch on a git repo


This is a very basic GUI interface written in php that writes ssh login into to a sqlite database that is then used by a nodejs script that pulls all files from the remote server.
